# Captions

FilmCraft keeps captions on **caption tracks** in the sequence, shown in their own area above the
video tracks (as Premiere does). Caption tracks are saved in the `.fcproj` (project format
version 2; version 1 projects open with no caption tracks).

## Model

- **Caption track** (`CaptionTrack`, `crates/project/src/caption.rs`): name, format (`Subtitle`,
  `CEA-608`, `CEA-708`, `Teletext`), language, output eye (shown in the Program monitor and
  burned in on export), lock, sync lock, and a **track style**:
  font size (pixels at 1080 lines, scaled to the frame), text colour, background box and its colour,
  outline width and colour, alignment (left/centre/right), position (top/middle/bottom) and
  margin (a fraction of the frame height, default 0.08; `captions.setStyle` clamps it to 0–0.45),
  line spacing, and a word **animation** (static by default; see [Animated captions](#animated-captions)).
- **Caption**: in/out in exact `Tick`s, text (lines separated by `\n`; `<i>`, `<b>`, `<u>` kept
  as written), optional speaker, the WebVTT cue id and cue settings, kept for round trips, and
  optional **word timings** (`words`: start, duration and text of each word, in sequence ticks).
  Captions on a track never overlap.

## Files

| Format | Import | Export | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SubRip `.srt` | ✓ | ✓ | Forgiving reader (BOM, UTF-16, Windows-1252, CRLF, missing indexes, `,`/`.` ms, missing hours). |
| WebVTT `.vtt` | ✓ | ✓ | Keeps cue ids, cue settings, `<v Speaker>`, STYLE/REGION/NOTE blocks. `line:N%` and `align:` are honoured when drawing. |
| Scenarist SCC `.scc` | ✓ | ✓ | CEA-608 at 29.97 fps. Reads pop-on, roll-up and paint-on; writes pop-on with drop-frame (default) or non-drop timecode. |

`File ▸ Import` (or dropping a file) recognises caption files by extension and content and adds a
new caption track to the open sequence (a sequence is created when none is open). Cue times are
snapped to the sequence's frames. `File ▸ Export ▸ Captions…` writes the chosen caption track in
the format given by the file extension (`.srt`, `.vtt`, `.scc`).

Details of each format and the SCC encoder are in [`crates/captions/README.md`](../crates/captions/README.md).

## Editing

| Command | Menu / shortcut | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `captions.newTrack` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Add New Caption Track… (⌥⌘A) | `format`, `name`, `language` |
| `captions.add` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Add Caption at Playhead (⌥⌘C) | `track`, `text`, `time`, `durationSeconds` (3) |
| `captions.next` / `captions.previous` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Go to Next/Previous Caption Segment (⌥⌘↓/↑) | |

| `captions.split` | Text panel ✂ | `caption`, `time` (default: every caption under the playhead) |
| `captions.merge` | Text panel | `captions` (consecutive, one track) |
| `captions.setText` | Text panel text field | `caption`, `text`, `speaker` |
| `captions.setTimes` | Text panel in/out fields | `caption`, `start…`/`end…` (`Time` ticks, `Frame`, `Seconds`, `Timecode`) |
| `captions.trim` | drag a caption edge in the timeline | `caption`, `edge` (`in`/`out`), `delta` or `deltaFrames` |
| `captions.move` | drag a caption in the timeline | `captions`, `delta` or `deltaFrames` |
| `captions.delete` | Edit ▸ Clear / Ripple Delete with captions selected | `captions`, `ripple` |
| `captions.select`, `captions.goTo` | click / number button | `captions`, `add` / `caption` |
| `captions.setTrack` | caption track header (eye, lock) | `track`, `name`, `format`, `language`, `enabled`, `locked`, `syncLock` |
| `captions.setStyle` | Text panel style strip | `track`, `size`, `color`, `background`, `backgroundColor`, `outline`, `outlineColor`, `align`, `anchor`, `margin`, `lineSpacing`, `animation` (`none`/`karaoke`/`pop`/`boxed`), `highlightColor` (karaoke), `popScale` (pop, 0.5–3), `boxColor` and `boxPad` (boxed, pixels at 1080 lines, 0–200), `safeArea` (`top`/`middle`/`bottom`), `reset` |
| `captions.deleteTrack` | | `track` |
| `captions.import` / `captions.export` | File ▸ Export ▸ Captions… | `path`, `format`, `track`, `dropFrame` |
| `captions.list` | (query) | `track`: tracks, styles (with `animation` and its parameters in `captions.setStyle` names) and captions with timecodes and their word-timing count `words` (a `track` that names no caption track is an error) |

Tracks are addressed by id or `"C1"`, `"C2"`… (top first). Edits are limited by neighbouring
captions and a one-frame minimum. Sync-locked caption tracks follow insert and extract edits on
the media tracks (a caption across an insert point is split). `Add Edit to All Tracks` (⇧⌘K)
also splits captions.

## Timeline and Text panel

- Caption rows: header with `C1…` badge, lock, output eye, name and format; caption blocks in
  violet showing their text (Arabic and Hebrew in reading order from the block's right edge). Click selects (⌘/⇧ adds), drag moves, edge drag trims, double-click
  opens the Text panel. Automation ids: `timeline.caption.<id>`,
  `timeline.captionTrack.C1[.locked|.enabled]`.
- **Text panel ▸ Captions**: search, track picker (also creates tracks of each format), add /
  split / merge / delete / export buttons, the list of segments with editable in/out timecodes
  and text (committed when the field loses focus; Arabic and Hebrew show in reading order and are
  edited in logical order while the field has focus), and the track style strip (size, colour, box,
  alignment, position; the font dropdown's list starts with the animation presets Static /
  Karaoke / Word pop / Boxed word and the 9:16 safe-area positions). Automation ids: `text.tab.Captions`, `text.captions.add|split|merge|delete|export|search|track`,
  `text.captions.<id>.in|out|text|goto|row`, `text.captions.style.*`.

## Burn-in

The Program monitor shows the visible caption tracks. On export, `file.exportMedia`
`{"burnCaptions": true}` (Export mode: **Burn Captions Into Video**) draws them into every frame.
Captions are set in Inter SemiBold (OFL, bundled) by the text engine (`crates/text`: shaping,
kerning, bidi); italics/bold markup is not yet drawn differently. The captions of a nested sequence
are part of the nest's picture: they are drawn wherever the nest is shown, in the Program monitor
and in every export, whether or not the outer sequence shows or burns in its own.

## Animated captions

Captions made by **Create Captions** from a transcript (`transcript.createCaptions`) carry the
transcript's word timings. With a track animation set, burn-in animates them word by word, the
same way in the Program monitor and in export:

| `animation` | Effect | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | static (default) | |
| `karaoke` | words at or before the playhead take the highlight colour | `highlightColor` |
| `pop` | the word being spoken is drawn larger around its centre and baseline | `popScale` (1.25) |
| `boxed` | a filled box behind the word being spoken | `boxColor`, `boxPad` (10 px at 1080 lines) |

Captions without word timings (typed, imported from files) always draw statically. Animations are
burn-in only: SRT, WebVTT and the other caption files are written exactly as before, without word
timing.

How word timings follow edits:

- moving a caption (move, ripple delete, insert or extract after it) moves its words;
- trimming keeps the words where they are and clamps them into the caption (a word outside it
  becomes zero-length at that edge; words are never dropped while the text still shows them);
- setting in/out moves the words by the change of the in point, then clamps them;
- splitting gives each half the words that start on its side and cuts the text at that word
  boundary, keeping line breaks but dropping inline markup (if all words start on one side, both
  halves keep the whole text and all words);
- merging joins the word lists; editing the text keeps the words only while they still spell it
  word for word (line breaks and markup may change), otherwise they are cleared.

`safeArea` sets the ordinary `anchor` and `margin` to keep a caption on a 9:16 picture clear of the
buttons that short-video apps draw over it (top 0.12, middle centred, bottom 0.22 of the frame
height); `anchor` or `margin` given in the same call win.
